# Top 100 Songs Predictor
![spotify](https://github.com/Tinkybala/Spotify-Top-Song-Prediction/assets/101686061/d1db90db-3f4b-43a3-bfd2-5c8796d1e801)


In this mini-project, we did some data processing and visualisation and then applied various machine learning models to predict whether a song would appear in the top 100 charts of spotify.
## Models used:

**1)logistic regression**\
**2)k-nearest neighbors**\
**3)random forest**\
**4)XGBoost**\
**5)Multilayer Perceptron**

To ensure robustness of our models, we also used our models to predict whether a song appears in the top 100 charts for other music streaming service providers like apple music, shazam and deezer


## Conclusion
- With the given dataset it is difficult to accurately predict whether a song appears in the top 100 list. Perhaps, with more features we could have achieved more accurate models.
- All the models used did not achieve a good accuracy

## What we Learnt
- Metrics like recall, precision and F1 score
- Using github
- data processing techniques like one-hot encoding and scaling
- Neural Network basics from keras
- Various machine learning models from sklearn
