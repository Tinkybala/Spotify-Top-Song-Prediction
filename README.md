# Top 100 Songs Predictor

We did some data pre-processing and EDA and then applied various machine learning models to predict whether a song would appear.
We made use of logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, XGBoost and a Multilayer Perceptron to predict whether a song would appear in the top 100 charts of spotify. In addition, to ensure robustness of our models, we also used our models to predict whether a song appears in the top 100 charts for our music streaming service providers like apple music, shazam and deezer
