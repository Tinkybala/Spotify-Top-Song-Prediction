We did some data pre-processing and EDA and then applied various machine learning models to predict whether a song would appear in the top 100 charts of spotify\
Models used:\
<br/><br/>
1)logistic regression\
2)k-nearest neighbors\
3)random forest\
4)XGBoost\
5)Multilayer Perceptron \
To ensure robustness of our models, we also used our models to predict whether a song appears in the top 100 charts for other music streaming service providers like apple music, shazam and deezer
